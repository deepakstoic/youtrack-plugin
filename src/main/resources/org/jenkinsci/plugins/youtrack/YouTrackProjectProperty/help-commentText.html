<p>Enabling makes it possible to execute commands from the VCS commit message. It is inspired by how YouTrack integrates
    with TeamCity, as described
    <a target="_blank"
       href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/YTD4/Executing+Commands+from+Comment+to+VCS+Commit">here</a>. It
    does however not support batch commands.
</p>

<p>In short after <code>#issue-id</code> the rest of the line is interpreted as a command an sent to YouTrack. If the
    next line does
    not contain a # it will be considered as a comment to the command
    applied.
</p>

<p>An extra option in this integration is to write <code>!#issue-id command</code> and the command will be applied, but
    silently, that is, watchers of the issue will not be notified.</p>
